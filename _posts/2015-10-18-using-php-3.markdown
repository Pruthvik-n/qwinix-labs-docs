Please go through the Part-2 before you proceed with Part-3

**[Jump To Part-2][part-2]**

The **Step 3** would be the final step, to run the images. We run the image and spin up a container.

Type this command.

	sudo docker run -d -p 80:80 php_page/v1

<img src="{{site.baseurl}}/images/docker/php/php_docker_run.png"/>

And you are good to go. Open your browser and go to **http://localhost/index.php**

<img src="{{site.baseurl}}/images/docker/php/php_docker_run-1.png"/>

Congratulations!!

You have successfully dockerized a simple PHP page.
