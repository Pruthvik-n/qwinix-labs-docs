### Docker Hub

The Docker Hub is a cloud-based registry service for building and shipping application or service containers. It provides a centralized resource for container image discovery, distribution and change management, user and team collaboration, and workflow automation throughout the development pipeline.

### Specifically, Docker Hub provides the following major features and functions:

  * **Image Repositories**: Find, manage, and push and pull images from community, official, and private image libraries.

  * **Automated Builds**: Automatically create new images when you make changes to a source GitHub or Bitbucket repository.

  * **Webhooks**: A feature of Automated Builds, Webhooks let you trigger actions after a successful push to a repository.

  * **Organizations**: Create work groups to manage user access to image repositories.
	
  * **GitHub and Bitbucket Integration**: Add the Hub and your Docker Images to your current workflows.
